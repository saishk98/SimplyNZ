			<h2>Findability Vocabulary</h2>
				
			<p><b>SEO Techniques &amp; Utilities</b>: SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of affecting the visibility of a website or a web page in a search engine. There are many famous search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing. If the site is visited frequently by visitors, then it is ranked on top on the search results page. SEO may target different kinds of searches including image, local, video, and academic search.<br><br>The implementation of SEO techniques for Internet marketing strategy is analysing how search engines work, what people search for, how the actual search terms and keywords are typed into search engines and which search engines are preferred by their target audience.</p><img src="images/findability.png" alt="findability" id="findability">
			<p><b>Search</b>: A web search engine or Internet search engine is a software system that is designed to carry out web search (Internet search) which means to search the World Wide Web in a systematic way for particular information specified in a textual web search query. The search results are generally presented in a line of results, often referred to as search engine results pages (SERPs). The information may be a mix of links to web pages, images, videos, infographics, articles, and research papers. Some search engines also mine data available in databases or open directories. Unlike web directories which are maintained only by human editors, search engines also maintain real-time information by running an algorithm on a web crawler. Internet content that is not capable of being searched by a web search engine is generally described as the deep web.</p>
			<p><b>Findability theory</b>: Findability theory is a matter of ease where information is contained from a website that is found both from outside the website (using search engines and the like) and by users already on the website. Although findability has relevance outside the World Wide Web, it is usually used in the context of the web. Findability encompasses aspects of information architecture, user interface design, accessibility, and search engine optimization (SEO), among others.</p>
			<p><b>Flash &amp; Findability</b>: Flash creates many barriers to SEO and findability. Flash content is not always easily accessible to all users who might be using screen readers or to those who are using a mobile connection. If sites are built all in one Flash file, the site will create issues for those bookmarking certain pages and will make it difficult for users and search engines to navigate directly to needed content.<br><br> With all these difficulties in mind, some techniques are now available to make Flash elements more findable. Search engines look for semantic HTML mark-up. So to increase the findability of Flash elements, it is good practice to add HTML substitutes for .swf files. For example, when publishing .swf files from Flash you can add a title and description to the file in the document settings. This information helps search engines recognize information about the Flash content.</p>
			<p><b>Search engine friendly URLs</b>: Search engine friendly URLs are URLs that make sense to both humans and search engines because they explain the path to the particular page they point to. Since version 1.5, Joomla! is capable of creating and parsing URLs in any format, including SEF URLs. This does not depend on URL rewriting executed by the web server, so it works even if Joomla! runs a server other than Apache with the mod rewrite module. The SEF URLs follow a certain fixed pattern, but the user can define a short descriptive text (alias) for each segment of the URL. <br>
			  <br>
			  Internally, the local part of a SEF URL (the part after the domain name) is called a route. Creating and processing SEF URLs is therefore referred to as routing, and the relevant code is called a router.</p>
			<p><b>Traffic analysis</b>: Traffic analysis is the process of intercepting and examining messages to deduce information from patterns in communication, which can be performed even when the messages are encrypted. It can be performed in the context of military intelligence, counterintelligence, or pattern-of-life analysis, and is a concern in computer security. Traffic analysis tasks may be supported by dedicated computer software programs. Advanced traffic analysis techniques may include various forms of social network analysis.</p><img src="images/findability2.jpg" alt="findability2" id="findability2">
			<p><b>404-error pages</b>: A 404-error page is a web page designated to be displayed when a request triggers the HTTP 404-response code. This code means the client (or visitor) was able to locate the server, but not the specific destination. In other words, they found your site but not a specific page within your site. So, the server sends your browser a 404-response code, letting them know what happened. If the site's designer designated one, a 404-error page is loaded.</p>
			<p><b>Email marketing techniques &amp; utilities</b>: Email marketing is the highly effective digital marketing strategy of sending emails to prospects and customers. Effective marketing emails convert prospects into customers, and turn one-time buyers into loyal, raving fans.</p>
			<p><b>Online Marketing</b>: Online Marketing (Internet Marketing or Digital Marketing) refers to a set of strategies designed to drive attention to businesses using the internet. These strategies include SEO (search engine optimisation), social media marketing, PPC (pay-per-click), email marketing and affiliate marketing.</p>
			<p><b>Microformats</b>: Microformats are a set of defined HTML classes created to serve as consistent and descriptive metadata about an element that is designating it as representing a certain type of data. They allow software to process the information reliably by having set classes refer to a specific type of data rather than being arbitrary.<br><br>Although the content of web pages has been capable of some automated processing since the inception of the web, such processing is difficult because the mark-up elements used to display information on the web do not describe what the information means. Microformats can bridge this gap by attaching semantics and thereby removing more complicated methods of automated processing such as natural language processing or screen scraping. The use, adoption, and processing of microformats enables data items to be indexed, searched for, saved, or cross-referenced so that information can be reused or combined.</p>
